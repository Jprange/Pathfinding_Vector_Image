Pathfinding_Vector_Image
========================

This is an android application that when a standard vector graphic image is loaded into the application and you place
two points on map, the application draws a path between the two locations. 

The application also contains a step counter to detect when you step, as well as orientation detection so that
when you walk around the map updates your position. 

Currently, the pathfinding algorithm that is used is fast enough to be calculated on each step. The algorithm is located in 
the Path.java file
